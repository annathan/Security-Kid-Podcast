Andrew: Welcome to episode one. So, in this episode we're going to talk about what does technology mean to you, why is it important? What do you do with it and what concerns you have about technology? And all those sorts of different things and, I guess, we'll finish up with what do you think about or what do you wish other kids knew about security. So, let's start. What does technology mean to you?

Allira: What technology is, like, what you use, like, today’s thing\!

Andrew: What do you mean thing?

Allira: Like. Today's trend. The way people interact with each other so you technology is a way of interacting with each other people online

Andrew: OK. So why is it important for you to have that ability to interact with people through technology?

Allira: Well, I find it's important to interact with people and technology, especially with my friends. So that, like, if we haven't seen each other in a while. We just like kind of hanging out. But would not actually hanging out. 'Cause it's fun\!

Andrew: Alright, so you've touched on a couple of things there. You said you use it to keep in contact with your friends and chat with them because it's fun. So, what do you do with your friends online do you just chat with them? What do you do?

Allira: Sometimes I role play with them on certain games. Or I just play around. And we talk about stuff with other random people

Andrew: So the random people that you interact with that probably is a good segue into the next thing that we want to talk about. You play online games, obviously different things on different platforms and you do interact with random other people. What are some of the concerns that you have about those interactions with other people?

Allira: Their concerns that I have one of interacting, but like other random people is I don't know who is behind the screen.

Andrew: OK.

Allira: Of that person that I'm talking to.

Andrew: So do you have any like mechanisms in place? Are there any things that you do to try and figure out who those people are before you interact with them or? Is that like the is it… OK, I'll phrase it another way? Is it easy for you to tell whether or not it is a kid or an adult that you're playing with?

Allira: Younger kids type, they type with a lot of spelling mistakes. No capitals or like grammar, but whereas older kids, there like older people, they have like grammar correction.

Andrew: OK, so they will actually use like proper like sentence structures and things like that? OK.

Andrew: So what do you do so you're playing and you've got somebody in the game with you that, whatever game it might be, but there trying to get you to do or say something or leave and go and play. Other games with them. But you can tell from the way that they're writing that there an adult like do you have a way of dealing with that or anything that you would say or do?

Allira: I've done this a few times to some people actually like they telling me to go to this one place that I don't want to go and so, like, they asked me to accept that friend request or something and then go with them. So I say I did, and then pretend to go with them, but then. Bye. Just wait till they leave and then just keep playing.

Andrew: Alright, OK, so just the old fake them out. Haha is that the same sort of thing, like does that occur across the different platforms. Because I know you play on your iPad and you've got your Surface Go. You've got your Xbox and the PlayStation, does it happen across all the platforms or does it just happen on let's say the PC for example?

Allira: Ah. It happens I guess on all platforms. I guess, cos you’re seeing the one chat.

Andrew: OK. Would you say it's more prevalent on, like, games where you can chat, like I guess if you're playing Minecraft it's not as easy with Minecraft on the Xbox or the PlayStation, it's probably not as easy to have a chat window.

Allira: They often happen on the PC.

Andrew: OK. So are all your friends as aware of those types of things that happen like the people pretending to be kids and playing the games or yeah. Do you talk about it like with your friends? Is it something that concerns us when you're playing online that Hey that might be these adults on there, pretending to be like us?

Allira: Uh. We we just keep playing. An if they're trying to make us do stuff, we don't want to. We just ignore them here.

Andrew: So you said, just before with that, sometimes they get you to go to other parts of the game that you don't want to go to and things like that, and to accept their friend requests. What concerns you about those friend requests when some random send you a friend request online? What goes through your mind when you're thinking about it?

Allira: I'm just. I often think that because they just some random person that I don't know. Um. And so if I accept that from a quest they could be like probably ask for my information like. That even if I've never met them.

Andrew: So what do you mean your information like things like your real name and where you live in that sort of stuff?

Allira: Yeah, sometimes, like I've seen that like happened in games.

Andrew: OK.

Allira: So what's your name, what’s your phone number?

Andrew: Really they ask for phone numbers?

Allira: Yeah, my friend once told me that they were playing a game and then this random person in chat, said send me your Snapchat pics. And so.

Andrew: OK, that's somewhat concerning.

Allira: Yes. So they made up a random account. And told them that way.

Andrew: Right, OK, does that happen very often online with your games?

Allira: games. That role play games, so there over dramatic about things.

Andrew: Do the so in those games and you know, I've had some chats in the past, which will probably go into maybe future episodes and stuff about passwords and that sort of stuff in here, you gotta keep those protected but in those games as anybody ever start asking you questions about you know what's your favorite color and what's your favorite animal. And things like that, things that might potentially expose what a password might be.

Allira: Do you know?

Andrew: No, but suppose you don't go and add them, too many in random conversations and stuff anyway. So I guess we can talk a little bit about that now look a lot of your games involve you creating an account that you have to use them and you have to keep your passwords and all that sort of stuff, which we have lots of issues with your sisters, forgetting their passwords all the time and as I said, just before like you and I've had a lot of conversations in the past about passwords, does it concern you that people might be trying to get into your account to get access to your passwords and things like that.

Allira: It does get me a little. I could like eventually end up getting hacked.

Andrew: Uh-huh.

Allira: It doesn't, like it.. like it doesn't often concern me 'cause I'm not thinking about it, but if you do think about it.

Andrew: But there any other things, so I guess we're talking about games and stuff and I want to talk to you about that in specifically some other games, you play in some future episodes, but let's just have some general chat about your concerns about technology because I know this year, going to school, You wanted to surface go for a specific reason? Can you tell me a little bit about what that reason was?

Allira: Ah The reason was cos I thought it was cool 'cause. I saw you have one and it seems like or protective so. It was like it seemed harder to get into because there was like so many different ways to like get into but like they were all different.

Andrew: Like what, explain some of the ways or some of the things that you were interested in.

Allira: Like the face identity.

Andrew: Mhhm hmm. So we call that biometric security? Why did that stand out to you?

Allira: Well not many people, well actually pretty much no one looks like me so that's harder for them to get into. And like if it did get hacked and my password got changed or something and I forgot. What that was, I would have I could just use my face to get in?

Andrew: And what year is I guess that stemmed from an issue. You are having at school last year when they gave out the school accounts and everything. Can you tell everybody what happened when they gave you all your accounts last year?

Allira: Where kids went around asking for the birthday for everyone's birthday and so then like I thought that was very unsafe. So straight away. I went to my teacher and asked if I could get my password change, but it didn't work. So later on in the week. I went down like the library where they changed my password for me, so people were still asking for my birthday and I told them and said it's not going to work. You're not going to get in 'cause, I've changed my password.

Andrew: That’s a concerning issue. Recently I think your vice principal was talking to us about some of the kids. Were they in your class? That were logging on as other people and sending messages to some of the teachers.

Allira: I don't think it was my class.

Andrew: What is your year though definitely?

Allira: I’m sure it was in some people in my year 'cause I think one year someone like when we were borrowing computers like someone had borrowed the computer but forgot to log out so some other kid who got the computer. who got who found that found that computer then went to send a message to the teacher like a very bad message. But the teachers knew it wasn't that kid that could would never send any message like what like what the message was. So the teachers went around investigating, and discovered who it was in the end.

Andrew: So I guess that's a pretty important topic. There isn't it like the fact that it’s your identity and who you log on online with that is essentially you if those people can get on and use your password in your email or whatever you use to get online and they can theoretically represent themselves as you so that's concerning on lots of levels. 'cause they could have potentially impacted that kids school work if you had file saved in. Like I think you would use Google Drive or something so they could have done a lot of stuff to that poor kid. Rather than just sending nasty messages to teachers. They could have deleted all their work and all sorts of stuff and potentially caused him a few issues right, which isn't great. So I guess that's like one big bundle then we can probably talk about that in another episode about you know what your identity means and ways that you should control it and protect it and obviously, you, wanting to use biometric security is a really good way. You also use your fingerprint on your phone when it is charged up. So I like the fact that you're conscious about that and that's why I was laughing with some friends, the other day that you probably played me a little bit to get yourself a new device for Christmas by telling me that you wanted to use the biometric stuff.

Andrew: So we touched on a couple of good things here that we can probably talk about in future episodes. But I guess we can close out today with, what’s one thing that you wish other kids knew about technology, like something that you come across with your friends at school, all the time and they don't really they start talking about things or something but they don't really address it as much as you might want them to or they don't understand things that the way you might, considering some of the conversations that we have.

Allira: I think that many people not but many of them realize like them going around asking for like the birth dates is a funny thing because most of them were like haha thanks and then would laugh about it and I don’t think that was right.

Andrew: So you don't think that they understand how serious it is to pretend to be somebody else with their identity.

Allira: And last year, I saw another thing like if one of the friends went to the bathroom, especially the boys, but they would search up something inappropriate and then delete it from the history, not realizing that was able that was being able to recover.

Andrew: Right. So they probably don't understand the fact that the school would keep a log of Internet search histories anyway, even if it's deleted off the device. Yeah, that's pretty, pretty bad so.

Allira: Yeah, I guess

Andrew: So the key thing there that you use it. You just wish that kids understood how serious it was to do things like that, and the implications that it could have going forward. Cos actually impersonating people online is actually a crime. You're not supposed to do it, and actually, it's probably against every year that, as your parents, when you re-sign up to say that you can use the school computer system. We're supposed to talk to you, and Mum and I do, talk to you about making sure that you understand that you've got the particular rules and regulations that you have to comply with for your school stuff. They are breaking those, so they could potentially lose all their privileges and all that sort of stuff as well, which isn't great. It's pretty pretty serious thing that they messing around with.
